        <h3 id="bio">BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the gang,
            and is
            the
            one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain. He is sophisticated
            but
            nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose idea it originally was. His grandfather
            had
            fought
            against the fascists in Italy. He was the mastermind behind the plans of the two heists. He controlled the
            heist
            through a hiding outside the Royal Mint.[2] The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police
            investigator
            leading the case against the heist. He sleeps with her and when her mother finds out about his involvement
            with
            the
            heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take advantage of her poor
            memory
            and
            deleting the voicemail. The Professor spent years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and covered
            aspects
            that most people wouldnt think of. His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to buy more time
            for
            the
            money to be printed and the team to escape.</p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>ROYAL MINT :</strong> The big idea is to rob the Royal Mint, where all the money in Spain is
                printed. By taking 67 hostages and
                locking the place down for a little over a week, they hope to print â‚¬2.4 billion in unmarked bills and
                escape without any bloodshed. Of course, thats easier said than done>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>BANK OF SPAIN : </strong> Professor calls in the old team as well as three new members, Palermo
                (an old friend of Berlin's),
                Bogota and Marseille, to plan an even larger heist designed to free Rio and strike a blow to the corrupt
                establishment. This time, the target is The Bank of Spain, where the country's gold reserve is stored in
                a
                maximum security vault.</li>

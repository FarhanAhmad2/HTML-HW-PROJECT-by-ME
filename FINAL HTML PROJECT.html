            <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p>The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the
                gang, and is
                the
                one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain. He is
                sophisticated but
                nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose idea it originally was. His
                grandfather had
                fought
                against the fascists in Italy. He was the mastermind behind the plans of the two heists. He controlled
                the heist
                through a hiding outside the Royal Mint.[2] The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police
                investigator
                leading the case against the heist. He sleeps with her and when her mother finds out about his
                involvement with
                the
                heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take advantage of her poor
                memory
                and
                deleting the voicemail. The Professor spent years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and
                covered
                aspects
                that most people wouldnt think of. His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to buy more
                time for
                the
                money to be printed and the team to escape.</p>

            <h3>ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>ROYAL MINT :</strong> The big idea is to rob the Royal Mint, where all the money in Spain
                    is printed. By taking 67 hostages and
                    locking the place down for a little over a week, they hope to print â‚¬2.4 billion in unmarked bills
                    and
                    escape without any bloodshed. Of course, thats easier said than done>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>BANK OF SPAIN : </strong> Professor calls in the old team as well as three new members,
                    Palermo (an old friend of Berlin's),
                    Bogota and Marseille, to plan an even larger heist designed to free Rio and strike a blow to the
                    corrupt
                    establishment. This time, the target is The Bank of Spain, where the country's gold reserve is
                    stored in a
                    maximum security vault.</li>
